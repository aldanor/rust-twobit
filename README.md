# TwoBit file format library

The [TwoBit file format](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format7) is
used to store genomic sequences on disk. It allows for fast access to specific
parts of the genome.

This rust library is inspired by the [py2bit python
package](https://github.com/deeptools/py2bit).

This Rust library does not have any dependencies an can be installed directly
from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/twobit).
